<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">2 <span
class="smcap">Cor</span>. ii. 17, and iii. 1&ndash;6.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God:
but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we
in Christ.&nbsp; Do we begin again to commend ourselves?&nbsp; Or
need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or
letters of commendation from you?&nbsp; Ye are our epistle,
written in our hearts, known and read of all men: forasmuch as ye
are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by
us; written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God;
not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.&nbsp;
And such trust have we through Christ to Godward; not that we are
sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of God; who hath made us able ministers of the
New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the
letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &ldquo;speak the same thing,&rdquo;&mdash;to &ldquo;be of
one mind in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&rdquo;&mdash;to
be altogether one in the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, and
in the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, as they are one, is the
proper habitude of all the members of the church, and especially
of all ministers of the word, of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Because,
however, of human imperfections, differences have arisen in the
church, even from the earliest and holiest days.&nbsp; Wherefore
controversy in the present day need not surprise us; nor should
we shun it as if it were necessarily unchristian; nor is any man
obliged to take part in it with any other feelings than such as
are holy and benignant.&nbsp; With good will may we withstand or
intreat one another, or earnestly contend for the faith against
an adversary.</p>
<p>Did not the apostle Paul withstand Peter to the face, with
feelings anything but personally hostile, because he was to be
blamed for his dissembling example: and does not the silence of
the story most eloquently speak the silent and affectionate
concession of the brother who was blamed?</p>
<p>Do not the words, which I have just read, bring before us
another early conflict in holy times: when &ldquo;many&rdquo;
teachers of the word of <span class="smcap">God</span>
&ldquo;corrupted&rdquo; it, and the apostle had to maintain the
truth against them as &ldquo;<i>false apostles</i>&rdquo; <a
name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> appealing in his own behalf to sanctions
given to him by <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself?&nbsp; And
are we not safely to conclude that his zeal and charity in the
contest obtained a blessed recompense in the preservation of many
from those ruinous corruptions.</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Now it is
observable that the apostle concentrates the strength of his
defence, in this particular passage, in an appeal to the work of
the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span> attending his ministrations.&nbsp;
Whatever might be the truths or errors brought into
question,&mdash;whether concerning the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span> Himself, or other subjects of a different
nature,&mdash;there were such effects of his labours to be seen,
as would prove the presence of that <span class="smcap">Divine
Spirit</span> with <i>his</i> ministry, and not with the
contrary.&nbsp; And hence we may infer, that though all teachers
among Christians will assert their possession of the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>, all may not possess Him; and the
teaching of some may want this remarkable and distinguishing
evidence of being from <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>We need not dissemble that our own Church is Corinthian in
this respect in the present day.&nbsp; We clergy are so.&nbsp; We
cannot&mdash;(and in my heart I feel deeply what I say)&mdash;we
cannot all be right.&nbsp; And it is my honest and heart-rending
conviction, that some of our differences are such, as will
separate us for ever, if we die in them.</p>
<p>But come now, and let us reason together.&nbsp; We have all,
by our outward vocation, one common interest in one common and
most momentous work.&nbsp; We have to save our own souls, and the
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>souls of
them that hear us.&nbsp; Our responsibilities reach into
eternity!&nbsp; May we by love so serve one another that we may
all be workers together with <span class="smcap">God</span> in
the immense design, for which His Son our Saviour died upon the
cross; that in the great day of His appearing many converted
souls may be <i>our</i> &ldquo;epistles of commendation&rdquo;
before His throne in glory!</p>
<p>Concerning the great controversy, which at present pervades
our church, some things relate to the Holy Ghost Himself, some
more especially to the Lord Jesus Christ, some to the Holy
Scriptures, some more particularly to the church.</p>
<p>Whatever of these I may notice, I wish to keep the <span
class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> prominently in our view, and to
make our truth or error, <i>as bearing upon Him</i>, the main
matter of our discourse.&nbsp; The general subject will be <i>The
sanction of that </i><span class="smcap"><i>Divine
Person</i></span><i> in the </i><span class="smcap"><i>Holy
Trinity</i></span>, <i>attending one sort of doctrine and
ministry</i>, <i>and not another</i>, <i>and the evidences to be
observed of the fact</i>: and it will involve this question,
namely, Who are <i>the true ministers of the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Lord Jesus Christ</i></span>, <i>accredited by
the </i><span class="smcap"><i>Holy Ghost</i></span>?</p>
<p>If I state things which some of us well know, I feel confident
that they will admit the importance of my bringing them before
others, who may not be aware of the position at which <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>we are already
arrived in the matters we have to speak of.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; The first thing which I have to propound is this:
That <i>the </i><span class="smcap"><i>Holy Ghost</i></span><i>
is the essential Agent in the right administration and reception
of divine ordinances</i>.&nbsp; In this, taken generally, we are
all agreed.</p>
<p>None of us doubts that the words of the apostle to the
presbyters of Ephesus would now apply to all true presbyters of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>: &ldquo;Take heed to
yourselves, and to all the flock, over which <i>the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Holy Ghost</i></span><i> hath made you</i>
overseers, to feed the church of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
which He hath purchased with His own blood.&rdquo; <a
name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a>&nbsp; So, the seven deacons were
&ldquo;men full of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> and
wisdom.&rdquo; <a name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a>&nbsp; The word also is said to be
&ldquo;preached <i>with the </i><span class="smcap"><i>Holy
Ghost</i></span> sent down from heaven:&rdquo; to come to those
hearing it aright, &ldquo;in power <i>and in the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Holy Ghost</i></span>, and in much
assurance;&rdquo; <a name="citation5c"></a><a href="#footnote5c"
class="citation">[5c]</a> and to be received with
&ldquo;<i>joy</i> <i>of the </i><span class="smcap"><i>Holy
Ghost</i></span>;&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>in demonstration of the
Spirit</i> and of power.&rdquo; <a name="citation5d"></a><a
href="#footnote5d" class="citation">[5d]</a>&nbsp; And so, both
in regard to ministers and members of the church, it is declared,
that &ldquo;to one is given <i>by the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Spirit</i></span> the word of wisdom, to another
the word of knowledge <i>by the same </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Spirit</i></span>, to another faith <i>by the
same </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Spirit</i></span>;&rdquo;&mdash;all these more
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>ordinary
gifts, as well as those which were miraculous, &ldquo;worketh
that one and the self-same <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>,
dividing to every man severally as he will.&rdquo; <a
name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a>&nbsp; And when it is also solemnly
declared&mdash;&ldquo;I give you to understand, that <i>no
man</i> can say (aright) that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> is
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, <i>but by the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Holy Ghost</i></span>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&mdash;and that &ldquo;if any man have
<i>not</i> the <span class="smcap">Spirit of Christ</span>, he is
none of His;&rdquo; <a name="citation6c"></a><a
href="#footnote6c" class="citation">[6c]</a>&mdash;how clear and
unquestionable is the conclusion, that <i>the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Holy Ghost</i></span><i> must be the essential
Agent</i> in the right administration and reception of divine
ordinances; and that in fact there can be none without Him, in
the minds both of ministers and people.</p>
<p>Hence it was that, in the words before us, the apostle
declared his &ldquo;<i>sufficiency</i> to be of <span
class="smcap">God</span>;&rdquo; that it was of <span
class="smcap">God</span> that he ministered the word without
corrupting it, as some did; and that the beautiful lineaments of
the living christian character, which he had been the means of
producing in them, were actually produced by the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, thus divinely authenticating the
office and instrumental ministrations of the apostle.&nbsp; Here
was the writing of his recommendatory letters.</p>
<p>This view of things carries in it the point, that no man can
be a true minister of Jesus Christ, unless the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
be with him.&nbsp; And <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>so general is the conviction of this
as a fact, that strange indeed would it be to find a single
bishop, priest, or deacon of our church, who should not feel it
essential to his integrity to lay claim to this holy
authentication of himself from God to men.</p>
<p>Now here is the question!&nbsp; Let us calmly and seriously
examine it.&nbsp; Can we all have the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>, who lay claim to His presence and power with
us?&nbsp; I propose to meet this question negatively, and
therefore,</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; My next position is the following: <i>That it is
impossible to suppose that we </i><span
class="GutSmall"><i>ALL</i></span><i> have the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Holy Ghost</i></span>, <i>who lay claim to his
presence and power in our ministrations</i>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The awful ungodliness of some of us too plainly
proves the truth of this, believe it who will.&nbsp; It is
fearful to think of their standing as they are in the sanctuary
of the Most <span class="smcap">Holy God</span>!&nbsp; &ldquo;To
the wicked <span class="smcap">God</span> saith, What hast thou
to do, to declare my statutes, and to take my covenant in thy
mouth?&nbsp; Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words
behind thee.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But, alas!&nbsp; It is not only the unholy beyond
dispute that may fail of the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>.&nbsp; What say the habits of vain conversation in
many; their ease and pleasure in worldly occupations and
amusements; their constraint under sacred employments, <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>their gladness
when such works are done?&nbsp; Must <i>their</i> hearts be the
temples of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>?&nbsp; Will
He make the word to be &ldquo;the power of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; to honour <i>their</i> preaching
of it; or the sacraments means of grace, to own <i>their</i>
administration?&nbsp; May He not, does He not refuse to do
so?&nbsp; Where is the fruit of their labour?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But even were we questionable in nothing but points
of doctrine and religious practices which we teach, this were
enough, not only to raise the question, whether we minister by
the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, but also to determine
it.&nbsp; For the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> cannot
testify to <i>both</i> of two systems <i>differing</i> from one
another in many fundamental points.</p>
<p>Such are the two systems at present in agitation.&nbsp; That
of Protestant Evangelical Christianity on the one hand, and that
of Anglo-catholicity on the other: the one rejecting Romanism in
all its peculiarities; the other sympathizing with it, and
avowedly rejecting the principles of the Protestant faith. <a
name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; The controversy is not new,
though it has seldom been so vigorously conducted on either side
as now.&nbsp; The same spirits were in active warfare some forty
years ago. <a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a>&nbsp; But, in fact, it has <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>been fairly
said by one of the chief writers on the Anglo-catholic side, that
there have ever been these two principal parties in the Church of
England, whom he calls the <i>Apostolical</i> and the
<i>Puritan</i>; introducing a third also, (not now in the
controversy,) namely, the Latitudinarian. <a
name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a></p>
<p>In point of <i>doctrine</i>, the terms Apostolical, Laudian,
Orthodox, and Anglo-catholic, have more or less of connexion with
each other; and the terms Evangelical, Puritan, Calvinistic, and
Protestant, have a similar affinity.</p>
<p><i>a</i>.&nbsp; Now it has often been acknowledged by the
opposite party, that the compilers of our Articles were not only
Protestant, but Calvinistic, and what we now call Evangelical, in
their religious views.&nbsp; It has often been felt and allowed,
that, in the <i>plain and full meaning</i> of these Articles,
according to their <i>literal and grammatical sense</i>, which
the royal Declaration peremptorily claims for them, without
admitting of <i>any new sense</i> whatever, they favour less the
Laudians and the Arminians, than the Puritans and Calvinists. <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a>&nbsp; In this <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>sense they
are freely and confidently appealed to by the latter; and the
appeal is ever most happily and strongly sustained by other
appeals to the writings of the Reformers, in proof of what they
meant.&nbsp; The true Protestants, therefore, are perceived to
have always had the best of the controversy, <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>when
conducted by sustaining the full and literal sense on the one
hand, and softening it down on the other:&mdash;wherefore it is
now attempted, with a determination never shown before, not
merely to incline the Articles to speak a softer Protestantism;
but at once to seize them violently, and force them to an
absolute recantation; or, to stifle them under the reiterated
pressure of directly antagonist opinions; affirming, against
evidence, that those opinions were <i>intended</i> by the
compilers to be admissible into the meaning! <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>They
thus, in purpose, completely take away the old, and substitute a
new confession of faith, whatever care may seem to be taken to
retain the form of words.&nbsp; And, casting out the
<i>Writings</i> of our Reformers also, as a Court of Appeal, and
proposing extraordinary additions to our Formularies, and various
ceremonial innovations, they declare it to be their intention to
<i>unprotestantize</i> <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a> the Church of
England altogether, and to re-unite her, in due time, with the
Church of Rome.&nbsp; And they are steadily and gradually
advancing.</p>
<p>While they are labouring with most devoted assiduity at this
achievement, we, on the other hand, are firmly maintaining our
old Church of England ground, standing by our old appeals as
resolutely as ever, and humbly believing that the same <span
class="smcap">God</span>, who has for years been gradually and
steadily increasing our numbers and our strength, will still go
on to increase them, until the Church of England shall stand in
the full and undisputed possession of the sons of her reforming
fathers; and <i>true</i> Anglo-catholicity shall be the share
which the English <i>Protestant</i> Church shall enjoy in
Catholic Christianity throughout the world.</p>
<p>But now, the question is, how can we possibly imagine that the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> can accredit <i>both</i>
these opposing systems, and the advocates of <i>both</i>, so
essentially differing from each other?&nbsp; For, <i>either</i>
the whole system of the Protestant Reformation, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and of our
Church as Protestant, is one enormous, awful, and tremendous
error; or Anglo-catholics are doubly dishonest, first to the
Church of England, which they still subscribe to; and secondly to
the <span class="GutSmall">TRUTH</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span> according to our confession of
faith.&nbsp; The decision of the question may be suspended for a
moment.</p>
<p><i>b</i>.&nbsp; The more we inquire into this subject, the
wider will the difference appear to be.&nbsp; There is one most
vital part of it, on which I will not say much; because it is so
generally heard of, and amongst ourselves so easily
understood.&nbsp; I mean the union, by the Anglo-catholics, of
tradition with Holy Scripture as the Rule of Faith, <a
name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a> in direct contradiction (as I think)
to our sixth Article.&nbsp; It is contradictory also to testimony
upon testimony from their own favourite Fathers and Divines, <a
name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a> as well as the Reformers; and even to
the plainest testimony of Holy Scripture itself.&nbsp; <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>&ldquo;From I
child,&rdquo; says the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span> by St. Paul to Timothy, &ldquo;thou hast
known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee <i>wise
unto salvation</i> though faith which is in <span
class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.&nbsp; All Scripture is given
by inspiration of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and is
profitable for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness; that the man of <span class="smcap">God</span> may
be <span class="GutSmall">PERFECT</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">THOROUGHLY FURNISHED</span> unto all good
works.&rdquo; <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p>Here, in particular, an opposition of sentiments appears upon
a vital point, in which the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>, in the very nature of things, can only take one
side.</p>
<p>But they <i>want</i> the tradition, and therefore they must
have it.&nbsp; It supports superstitions, which Scripture will
not.&nbsp; And the difficulty of explaining <i>ignota per
ignotiora</i> aggravates the importance of a present priesthood
to explain both, as may seem good to them, without the
possibility of popular private judgment being exercised on their
interpretations and conclusions.</p>
<p><i>c</i>.&nbsp; Again; their doctrine of mystery in religion,
putting, (by a strange mutation,) the most obvious things for the
deepest, is made particularly to produce a comparative silence
respecting the atonement of the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus
Christ</span>.&nbsp; It is remarkable that they should choose for
the example of this mysterious reserve, the very subject
concerning <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>which the Apostle St. Paul declares to the Corinthians,
&ldquo;I am determined not to know anything <i>among you</i>,
save <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, and Him
crucified:&rdquo; &ldquo;We preach not ourselves, but <span
class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>:&rdquo; &ldquo;We preach <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> <i>crucified</i>!&rdquo; <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a>&nbsp; But then, <i>their</i> Christ
crucified, by a painful perversion, is shown to be
<i>self</i>-crucified; tears, and penances, and mortifications
constituting their substitution for sin, (atonement I cannot call
it;) while <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is kept back,
chiefly for mere sacramental exhibition. <a
name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a></p>
<p>That glorious name of Jesus, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">the
Lord our righteousness</span>,&rdquo; they almost veil from our
sight, as far as His <i>obedience to the law</i> for us is
concerned; and His sole justification, <i>wrought for us</i>,
they actually displace by another thing.&nbsp; The Lutheran
doctrine upon the subject, which is that of our eleventh Article,
is called <i>radically and </i><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span><i>fundamentally monstrous</i>,
<i>immoral</i>, <i>heretical</i>, <i>and antichristian</i>. <a
name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a>&nbsp; And justification, instead of
being by the works and deserving of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> accounted unto us, and received by
faith, is said to consist in the &ldquo;habitation of Christ in
us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;of <span class="smcap">God</span> the <span
class="GutSmall">FATHER</span>, and the <span
class="GutSmall">WORD</span> incarnate, through the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>:&rdquo; &ldquo;the <span
class="smcap">Spirit&rsquo;s</span> work, not <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>:&rdquo; &ldquo;an imparting
of righteousness;&rdquo; <a name="citation16b"></a><a
href="#footnote16b" class="citation">[16b]</a> &ldquo;not
imputation merely, but the act of God imparting His divine
presence to the soul through baptism, and so making us temples of
the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c"
class="citation">[16c]</a>&nbsp; But something also is said about
our being able to &ldquo;<i>obey</i> unto justification,&rdquo;
<a name="citation16d"></a><a href="#footnote16d"
class="citation">[16d]</a> in opposition to Luther; which
intimates clearly that human works, resulting from this
indwelling, are to be the substantial justifying material; and
faith is to be the first of those works.&nbsp; For when they
refer to the Article, asserting that &ldquo;<i>we are justified
by faith only</i>,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;Faith, as being the
<i>beginning of perfect or justifying righteousness</i>, is taken
for what it tends towards, or ultimately will be.&nbsp; It is
said by anticipation to be that which it promises; just as one
might pay a labourer his hire, before he began his
<i>work</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation16e"></a><a
href="#footnote16e" class="citation">[16e]</a>&nbsp; And thus,
their Christ <i>justifying</i> <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>seems to be made much like their
<i>Christ crucified</i> in us; <i>self</i> imitating <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> in another part of His work.&nbsp; A
more complete removal of the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
out of His place in the great work of redemption, with a specious
introduction of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> to aid
in the removal, that man may do the <i>work</i> of his <i>own
justification</i>, it is not easy to conceive.&nbsp; Whether this
be right or not, judge ye.&nbsp; But that the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> should testify <i>both</i> to
this justification, <i>and</i> to that which is by faith only in
the righteousness of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, which is
the justification of the Protestant Reformers and their
Evangelical descendants, it is clearly impossible to suppose.</p>
<p><i>d</i>.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>
himself, and all that religion which consists in spiritual
experience, are expressly removed from full and ordinary
teaching,&mdash;the glory and excellency of them being consigned
to reverential reserve! <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>The new birth of the soul by the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>, (except as in baptism,) the fruits
of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> in holiness, the comfort
of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, the witness of the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, the seal, the earnest, the
fellowship, the indwelling, the anointing of the <span
class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>,&mdash;His work as a <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of wisdom and revelation in the
knowledge of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and the deep
things of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;a <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of intercession, a <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of adoption, a <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>glory, and all other subjects of
Christian experience, are to be said little about,&mdash;while it
is the very <i>fear</i> of others that they should grieve and
dishonour this glorious Person in the ever-blessed Trinity by not
fully declaring them.&nbsp; They are deeply impressed by the fact
that His work is equally essential to their salvation with that
of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Himself, and full of
consolation and delight.&nbsp; And some perhaps may be the more
intent upon preaching all that ever appertains to Him from a
spirit of holy jealousy, knowing that it is a subject in which so
many of us halt.</p>
<p>And what is their substitute?&nbsp; Mere morality with some:
devotions, fastings, and almsgiving, with our brethren who are
more in earnest; all busy in suspending fruits upon the evil
tree, to make it good; instead of &ldquo;first looking to the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span> to make the tree good, that his fruit
may be good also.&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p><i>e</i>.&nbsp; The <i>sacraments</i> are a subject in which
the difference and the controversy exhibit remarkably strong
characteristics.&nbsp; Our Anglo-catholics, it is <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>evident, use
the very term <i>sacrament</i> as if the <i>spiritual grace
signified</i> thereby constituted the substantial meaning of the
term: but our twenty-ninth Article shows at once that our
Reformers applied it to the <i>outward sign</i>; &ldquo;The
<i>sign</i> <span class="GutSmall">OR</span> <i>sacrament</i> of
so great a thing:&rdquo; and they there apply the term to the
bread and wine, in <i>contra-distinction</i> to the body and
blood of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; In the
twenty-fifth Article the sense is carried out, and the term is
applied to the <i>ceremony</i>, still having reference to that,
which is ordained of God indeed, but perceived by the outward
senses.&nbsp; And these are essential matters: for there is no
sacrament, by the same article, where there is no visible
<i>sign</i> or <i>ceremony ordained</i> of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; <i>Baptism</i> is called a
<i>sign</i> of regeneration, whereby they that receive it rightly
are, as by a significant process or instrument, not regenerated,
but visibly &ldquo;grafted into the church,&rdquo; as already
regenerated; <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a> and &ldquo;have the promises of
forgiveness and adoption,&rdquo; not then first brought home to
their souls, but &ldquo;visibly signed and sealed&rdquo; to
them;&mdash;&ldquo;faith,&rdquo; not first imparted, <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>but
&ldquo;stirred up&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;grace,&rdquo; not first
given, but &ldquo;increased, by virtue of prayer to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if the Liturgy and Catechism speak of the inward and
spiritual grace signified as <i>part</i> of the sacrament, or
seem to say that the sacrament of baptism, as much as that of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, is <i>a mean</i> of receiving that
particular grace which is signified,&mdash;they should be
explained so as to harmonize with the Articles, which do already
harmonize with Holy Scripture.&nbsp; It is a <i>part</i>, not as
tied to the Form in time and place, but as the distinct reality,
on which all the value of the formal representation is founded,
and which therefore should always be steadily eyed in it. <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>It is
evident that our twenty-seventh Article contemplated, in the body
of it, the baptism of adults, spiritually born.&nbsp; And though
our ritual prefers to <i>pray</i> for the <span
class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>, that they may <i>then</i>
surely have His regenerating grace, to presuming on the previous
certainty of its experience; yet the certain answer to this
prayer is assuredly taken for granted as the ceremony proceeds;
inasmuch as the acts of living souls are forthwith required of
the subjects <i>before</i> they are baptized; namely, that they
can speak spiritually, and deliver &ldquo;the answer of a good
conscience before God&rdquo; in the exercise of repentance and
faith, and the avowal of them.&nbsp; And so it is observable,
that though our form of <i>infant baptism</i> prefers to
<i>implore</i> regeneration <i>then</i>, to presuming certainly
that the infant <i>is</i> regenerated ere he comes, yet the fact
is <i>presumed</i> to be granted <i>previously</i> to the answers
being made; for they are the answers of a new-born soul.&nbsp;
Charity afterwards hopeth all things, though often
disappointed.&nbsp; And thus our church uniformly goes upon the
apostolic rule, given in answer to the question, &ldquo;What <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>doth hinder
me to be baptized?&rdquo; viz., &ldquo;<i>If thou believest with
all thine heart</i>, (which is the fruit of regenerating grace,
<a name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a>) thou mayest.&rdquo;&nbsp; A heart,
even in infants, that would show faith, if organs served, is
presumed to be; for &ldquo;except they be born again, they cannot
see the kingdom of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a>&nbsp; The law has no exception.</p>
<p>The terms <i>baptize</i> and <i>baptism</i> are used in
Scripture to express the spiritual regeneration as well as the
mystical.&nbsp; On the one hand, we hear of &ldquo;the
<i>Baptism</i> of John;&rdquo; &ldquo;I indeed <i>baptize</i> you
with water;&rdquo; &ldquo;he that believeth and is
<i>baptized</i>, shall be saved;&rdquo; &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Christ</span> sent me not to <i>baptize</i>;&rdquo;
&ldquo;there is one <i>baptism</i>;&rdquo; &ldquo;they were
<i>baptized</i> in the name of <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>baptizing</i> them
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>in the
name of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, and of the <span
class="smcap">Son</span>, and of the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>;&rdquo; and many other instances, having reference
only to baptism with water.&nbsp; On the other hand, we read,
with reference to <i>spiritual</i> baptism, &ldquo;He shall
<i>baptize you</i>,&rdquo; saith John, concerning Jesus,
&ldquo;<i>with the </i><span class="smcap"><i>Holy
Ghost</i></span> and fire;&rdquo; <a name="citation23a"></a><a
href="#footnote23a" class="citation">[23a]</a> where water is not
contemplated: &ldquo;<i>By one </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Spirit</i></span><i> are</i> we all&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>baptized</i> into one body.&rdquo; <a
name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;So many of us as were
baptized into <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, were
baptized into His death.&nbsp; Therefore we are buried with Him
by the <i>baptism unto death</i>, that like as <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> was raised from the dead by the glory
of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, even so we also should
walk in <i>newness of life</i>.&nbsp; Our old man is crucified
with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed;&rdquo; and
that we should &ldquo;yield ourselves unto <span
class="smcap">God</span>, as those that are <i>alive from the
dead</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation23c"></a><a href="#footnote23c"
class="citation">[23c]</a>&nbsp; And St. Peter, speaking of the
salvation of Noah through the flood, says, &ldquo;The antitype,
or counterpart, of which, even <i>baptism</i>, doth also now save
us; not the putting away of the filth of the <i>flesh</i>,&rdquo;
(which is of water baptism,) &ldquo;but the <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>answer of a
<i>good conscience</i> towards <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; (which is of spiritual baptism,)
&ldquo;by the resurrection of <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span> from the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; You have it <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a> also, where the apostle speaks of the
Colossians as &ldquo;circumcised with the circumcision made
without hands,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>buried</i> with <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> in <i>baptism</i>, wherein also they
were <i>risen with Him through faith</i> of the operation of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, and <i>quickened together with
Him</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a></p>
<p>Now, whether this latter <i>baptism</i> is, or is not, ever
without the former, and the washing of the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> only synchronous, or not, with that
of water; it is unquestionably evident that the two things are
perfectly <i>distinct</i>, the one from the other.</p>
<p>Proceed, however, a step further, and observe that it is not
water baptism which the <span class="smcap">Holy</span> oracles
speak of as the mean, instrument, or channel, of spiritual
baptism or regeneration, but <i>the Holy Scriptures
themselves</i> without it; and immediately the general
<i>separation</i> of the two is as clear as the distinction
between them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of His own will,&rdquo; saith St.
James, &ldquo;begat He us with <i>the word of truth</i>.&rdquo;
<a name="citation24c"></a><a href="#footnote24c"
class="citation">[24c]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Being born again,&rdquo;
saith St. Peter, &ldquo;not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, by <i>the word of </i><span
class="smcap"><i>God</i></span>, which liveth and abideth for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And this is the word, which by the
Gospel, (not water-baptism,) is <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>preached unto you.&rdquo; <a
name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; And add to this, concerning the
thousands of outwardly baptized sinners, the testimony of St.
John, that &ldquo;<i>whosoever is born of </i><span
class="smcap"><i>God</i></span><i> doth not commit sin</i>; <i>in
this</i> the children of <span class="smcap">God</span> are
manifest, and the children of the devil, <i>whosoever doeth not
righteousness is not of </i><span
class="smcap"><i>God</i></span>;&rdquo; <a
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a> and the proof is conclusive, that in
the formal baptism of these thousands upon thousands, who do so
commit sin, no regeneration of <span class="smcap">God</span> was
ever experienced at all.&nbsp; The separation is clear.&nbsp; Men
are born, without water-baptism, by the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> and the word; multitudes have it, and
are never born of <span class="smcap">God</span> at all. <a
name="citation25c"></a><a href="#footnote25c"
class="citation">[25c]</a></p>
<p>Against all this, however, the system of the Anglo-catholics
speaketh on this wise:&mdash;&ldquo;The Scriptures, the Church,
and the Fathers declare, with united voice, that regeneration
takes place at baptism.&nbsp; But they go farther; they tell us
very <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>definitely what regeneration is; they tell us that it is
an engrafting into <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; a new
creation in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; and by
consequence, that all the gifts of grace are actually and really
imparted to us in baptism; that in short we are justified,
sanctified, quickened, crucified with Christ, planted together in
the likeness of His death, risen with Him by the power of His
resurrection, and seated with Him in heavenly places; and that
all this is effected by baptism.&rdquo; <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; This is in a sermon entitled
&ldquo;Nehushtan, or an Attempt to break the Trifle of
Brass.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this Nehushtan is the doctrine of
justification by faith; concerning which I refer you to the glory
of our Articles, the eleventh; and then I close this point with
the plain question, <i>Who</i> are the true members of the Church
of England; and with whom is the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of the Holy Scriptures, the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of the martyrs of the Reformation,
the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of the living <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>?&nbsp; He cannot be with both.</p>
<p><i>f</i>.&nbsp; The assigning of regeneration and remission of
sins to <i>outward</i> baptism gives immediate occasion to many
other errors: but to one in particular, of a very lamentable
character.&nbsp; I mean the deplorable, and all but hopeless
condition of those, who sin away their regeneration, and their
plenary remission received in baptism; as innumerable multitudes
are held to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;The great majority,&rdquo; <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>say the
Anglo-catholics, &ldquo;die under the bond of their sins;&rdquo;
yet so far &ldquo;under <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
favour,&rdquo; that if they pray, and fast, and give alms, and
confess, mourn, and judge, humble, afflict, and abhor themselves,
they may peradventure obtain pardon somewhere, plenary pardon;
though it cannot be granted them any more in this life! <a
name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a>&nbsp; And that somewhere, is
Purgatory, plainly avowed! <a name="citation27b"></a><a
href="#footnote27b" class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<p>All this ministers strongly to the authority of a priesthood,
in confessions, partial absolutions, and penances; <a
name="citation27c"></a><a href="#footnote27c"
class="citation">[27c]</a> but our Church (Art. 22) seems to us
to say that it is plainly repugnant to the word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>: and so we believe.&nbsp; Certainly,
therefore, the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> is not with
<i>one</i> portion of us in this matter.&nbsp; We know of no
condition, except that of blaspheming against the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, in which, &ldquo;if we confess
our sins, <span class="smcap">God</span> is&rdquo; not
&ldquo;faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse
us from all unrighteousness;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;if <i>any</i> man
sin, we have an advocate with the <span
class="smcap">Father</span>, <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span> the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our
sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>g</i>.&nbsp; I shall not go over the same ground again, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>with
reference to the sacrament of the holy Communion, as I have done
with respect to Baptism, but state little more than that the way,
in which the Anglo-catholics treat it, is precisely similar.</p>
<p>Spiritual communion in the body and blood of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, which we hold that believers
<i>always may enjoy by faith</i> in the living <i>words of
</i><span class="smcap"><i>Christ</i></span>, the Anglo-catholics
bind inseparably to the sign or sacrament thereof; namely to the
bread and wine, and the sacred ceremonial.&nbsp; <i>Their</i>
body and blood of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is the bread
and wine <i>made so</i> by their priests, and given only by their
means to the people.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sacraments,&rdquo; to the
exclusion of other ordinances, &ldquo;are (with them) the sources
of divine grace.&rdquo; <a name="citation28a"></a><a
href="#footnote28a" class="citation">[28a]</a>&nbsp; One is the
very and only womb of regeneration itself; the other the only
breast that nurses the child of <span class="smcap">God</span>
with the very body and blood of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; These <i>forms</i> their
clergy can handle and talk about, and they reservedly hint at the
work of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span> in them: howbeit of spiritual life and
spiritual communion, as things distinct from them, and much more
large, and of other times and places, and means also, they
profess to believe nothing.&nbsp; They hold the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
mostly within their own sources; and the body and blood of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> quite at their own disposal. <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Now,
when our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> says, &ldquo;Except
ye eat my flesh and drink my blood ye have no life in you,&rdquo;
and it is held that the <i>baptized</i> have life, <i>though they
have not come</i> to the table of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>; it will needs be granted that eating
the flesh and drinking the blood of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> is a thing <i>previous</i> to coming
to that holy table: therefore it may be, as no doubt it is,
<i>after</i> coming thither also; of course in <i>other</i>
places and by the use of <i>other</i> means.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> says, therefore, &ldquo;Whoso eateth
my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life:&rdquo; and when
He would save them from the delusive idea of eating His carnal
body and blood, He tells them &ldquo;it is the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>,&rdquo; that is, the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> taking of the things of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and showing them unto us
spiritually, &ldquo;<i>that quickeneth</i>,&rdquo; ministereth
life; and then he refers them for the means, not to any
contemplated sign or sacrament, but to <i>His words</i> attended
by His <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>: &ldquo;The words that I
speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In them believers have their constant food.</p>
<p>The very flesh of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> itself, if
they could have it in a literal sense, would profit them nothing;
all that is effective being the &ldquo;ministration of the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even in the sacrament,
the <span class="smcap">Word</span>, thought of, and received by
faith of the operation of the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>, is that medium by which the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> most properly conveys the <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span> to the soul.&nbsp; The bread and
wine have no more in them than the <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>character of the most beautiful,
significant sign or sacrament of so great a thing: just as the
king&rsquo;s letters, and not his picture, even in the most
affecting transactions of his life or death, would really convey
the presence of his mind and attributes to his people.</p>
<p>It is, however, habitually true of this sacrament, though not
so of the other, that it is <span
class="GutSmall"><i>A</i></span><i> means</i> (not <span
class="GutSmall">THE</span> means) whereby the inward and
spiritual <i>grace signified</i> is received by the faithful.</p>
<p>But if the same precision were used in a review of our Liturgy
and Catechism, as was exercised in the framing of our Articles,
we might avoid asserting anywhere, as well as in the latter, that
the sacraments are means of the grace signified, without the loss
of anything essential; and so we should be saved from predicating
<i>that</i> in the <i>definition</i> of a thing, which is proved
not to be universally true of it.&nbsp; We might be saved from
seeming to affirm that we are made children of <span
class="smcap">God</span> <i>spiritually</i> by formal baptism,
when in fact it is only <i>formally</i> that we are thereby made
so; or by baptism are regenerate.&nbsp; That sacraments are
<i>signs</i> and <i>seals</i> to the faithful of the inward and
spiritual grace signified is universally true, and therefore
proper in a definition of them: that they are <i>means</i>
thereof, <i>or pledges</i>, <a name="citation30"></a><a
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a> is not universally
true, and therefore <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>improper in a definition, though true in part.&nbsp; And
our conflicts upon the subject will never be put an end to until
our church clearly expresses herself agreeably to the distinction
and separability between things spiritual and things formal. <a
name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a></p>
<p>It does not appear that any of the principal Protestant
Confessions of faith affirm the sacraments to be <i>means</i> of
<i>the</i> special grace signified by them, except the Augsburg,
which is the Lutheran.&nbsp; And if it is generally to this that
the English articles are to be traced, the difference of the
latter from the former upon this particular point can scarcely be
otherwise than purposely intended. <a name="citation31b"></a><a
href="#footnote31b" class="citation">[31b]</a></p>
<p>When our Anglo-catholic brethren seem as if they would
&ldquo;not oppose anything existing,&rdquo; <a
name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a> or touch so much as an iota of our
Anglican Confession in <i>verbal</i> alterations, and yet
hesitate not deliberately to sharpen their weapons, and at a few
gashes to <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>embowel it of its vitals; (I allude to the ninetieth
Tract;) if they describe our church as &ldquo;teaching with the
stammering lips of ambiguous formularies,&rdquo; and as
&ldquo;incomplete in her formal doctrine and discipline,&rdquo;
and would totally change her Protestant character by
<i>introductions</i> from the Roman Breviary and
Missal;&mdash;with all this havoc of change before us, it is a
small matter to desire merely a clearer distinction between
formal and spiritual things, or any other sanatory touch of like
character, which would fulfil the work of the Reformation,
instead of thoroughly undoing it, <a name="citation32a"></a><a
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a> as <i>they</i>
design to do.</p>
<p>In such a process we should be casting off the last frontlet
of our <i>ancient</i> grave-clothes, and putting a crown of pure
gold upon our head.&nbsp; Rome would have done with us for ever,
and we with Rome; and our separated brethren of other communions
would see the way opening for re-union to an unlimited
extent.</p>
<p><i>g</i>.&nbsp; The essentials of the <span
class="GutSmall">OFFICE</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">WORK</span> of the ministry, as propounded on
either side, constitute another very material ground of
difference. <a name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b"
class="citation">[32b]</a></p>
<p>We are, I suppose, agreed that the <i>first</i> essential <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of the <span
class="GutSmall">OFFICE</span> is, that we be clearly called to
it, and effectually sustained in it, by the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>.&nbsp; But when we come to the
outward and visible proofs of this call and this supporting
power, then we differ.&nbsp; The Anglo-catholics consider it
essential to be ordained by bishops receiving their appointment
in regular succession from the apostles; as that, without which
no benefit of sacraments or other ministrations can be imparted,
nor, in fact, any church exist.&nbsp; The Anglo-protestants, on
the other hand, attach not the same importance to the apostolical
succession of bishops; and will say with Melancthon, &ldquo;When
bishops do not teach the truth, an ordinary succession avails
nothing to the church;&rdquo; <a name="citation33a"></a><a
href="#footnote33a" class="citation">[33a]</a> and they hold that
the appointment of a bishop by presbyters among themselves is
valid.&nbsp; They consider the laying on of the hands of a bishop
and others of the presbytery, to be the most scriptural
Ordination of presbyters, and best for their own church; <a
name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a> yet not so essential to <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the being of
a church but that Ordination without a bishop may be valid, and
is so in other churches, and has scriptural succession in its
Presbytery.</p>
<p>By the former, it is assumed, that the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> is given in ordination to all who
are thus ordained, for the custody of the good deposit, the
fundamentals of doctrine and practice, and all other parts of
their office; and that through these ministers alone the people
can derive sacramental grace; and if this ordination once be
given, it is of itself the grand, essential, and sufficient proof
of a true minister, and of the abiding of the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, with him continually.</p>
<p>Now, it is true that we hold, that an evil minister, incurring
even deposition by our discipline, does not necessarily prevent
the communications of divine grace to the souls of men in the
ministration of the word and sacraments.&nbsp; But we hold also
that he is to be deposed, and that there is something vastly
contrary to the true system of things in his being where he is;
though <span class="smcap">God</span> has acted with inscrutable
wisdom in having suffered it.&nbsp; But unless ministers
continually prove by all the &ldquo;fruits of the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>,&rdquo; that the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span> is
with them, their ordination does nothing for <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>them in our
esteem, but load them with extraordinary sin and guilt.&nbsp; It
is expected, that they be &ldquo;not of the world;&rdquo; though
it is not by monasteries that they are to go out of it; but by
keeping themselves unspotted from the sins and vanities and pomps
of it; while their light shines before men in doing good in it,
for the glory of their heavenly <span
class="smcap">Father</span>.&nbsp; Their love of souls dictates
zeal and labour and self-denial and holy co-operation.&nbsp; They
weep and pray and wrestle with <span class="smcap">God</span> for
blessings on their unworthy ministrations; they reprove, rebuke,
exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine; they humble the
proud to penitence without penance; they comfort the
feeble-minded, and heal the broken-hearted, without the
unhallowed domination of confessionals, or absolutions other than
declarative or merely ecclesiastical; <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a> and they are
conscious of maintaining, (without forced explanations,) an
honest consistency, in doctrine and practice, with the plain
meaning of their own articles and of Holy Scripture.&nbsp; These
and all other fruits of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>,
love, joy, peace, long-suffering <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>gentleness, goodness, faith,
meekness, temperance;&mdash;these are their essential proofs of
office; without which the form of Ordination would be nothing but
a heavy grief to them.&nbsp; It always has been, moreover, and I
believe it ever would be, did circumstances lead to it, the
blessedness and glory of these men to die as martyrs for their
faith.&nbsp; The love of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> would
constrain them to do it joyfully.&nbsp; Few indeed are the clear
instances of any other kind of religious persecutions unto death;
while the thousands upon thousands of those who have been the
<i>usual</i> martyrs for <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, have
been, not of the Anglo-catholic, but of the Evangelical
faith.&nbsp; The <i>Reformers</i> are granted to us: the
<i>Huguenots</i>, the <i>Waldenses</i>, the <i>Lollards</i> and
<i>Hussites</i>, the <i>Paulicians</i>, the martyrs of Lyons and
Vienne, &amp;c., have all been of the same confession of faith
and the same character.&nbsp; But, alas! if the likeness of the
Anglo-catholic creed and practices to Popery be considered, how
near are the professors of that creed most fearfully coming to
the character of the accusers of the brethren, the persecutors of
the saints, the very crucifiers of the <span class="smcap">Lord
of Glory</span>!&nbsp; With whom then is the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> to be supposed to be?</p>
<p>So, with respect to the essentials of ministerial <span
class="GutSmall">WORK</span>, they say that &ldquo;the
Church,&rdquo; i.e. the Clergy, and <i>her sacraments</i>, are
the ordained and visible <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>means of conveying to the soul what
is supernatural and unseen. <a name="citation37"></a><a
href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The
sacraments, <i>not</i> preaching, are the sources of divine
grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not disparage the sacraments; but we
say that in holy Scripture preaching has the pre-eminence;
preaching the Gospel of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
&ldquo;the everlasting Gospel,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Gospel of
salvation,&rdquo; &ldquo;the glorious Gospel of the blessed <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I am anxious that we
should all feel this, understand it well, and study to be
&ldquo;able ministers of the New Testament.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Anglo-catholic doctrine of the wonderful importance of
sacramental grace and of the mysterious dignity and power of the
priesthood in connexion with it, is a comparative nullifying of
the great commission of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
&ldquo;Go ye into all the world, and <i>preach the Gospel to
every creature</i>; he that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved; and he that believeth not shall be damned.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> also sent the apostle Paul,
&ldquo;not&rdquo; with a commission, &ldquo;to baptize,&rdquo;
though he did baptize; &ldquo;but to preach the
Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And his triumphant argument for preaching,
as the grand mean of grace, and faith, and salvation, will never
be overcome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever shall call upon the name of
the Lord shall be saved.&nbsp; How then shall they call on Him in
whom they have not believed; and how shall they believe in Him of
whom they have not heard; and how shall they hear <i>without
</i><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span><i>a
preacher</i>; and how shall they preach except they be
sent?&nbsp; As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them
that <i>preach the Gospel of peace</i>, <i>and bring glad tidings
of good things</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation38a"></a><a
href="#footnote38a" class="citation">[38a]</a>&nbsp; Of
regeneration itself as produced by the special instrumentality of
the word, we have already heard: and so also the remission of
sins; for &ldquo;be it known unto you,&rdquo; says St. Paul to
the people of Antioch in Pisidia, &ldquo;that through this man is
<i>preached</i> unto you the forgiveness of sins; and by Him all
that believe are justified from all things from which ye could
not be justified by the law of Moses.&rdquo; <a
name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a>&nbsp; The Acts of the Apostles, in
fact, are full of it.&nbsp; By the foolishness of
<i>preaching</i> it has always pleased <span
class="smcap">God</span> to save them that believe, incomparably
more than by any other means.&nbsp; And forasmuch as the
ministers and stewards of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
mysteries &ldquo;cannot,&rdquo; (as our Ordination Service
speaks,) &ldquo;by any other means compass the doing of so
weighty a work, pertaining to the salvation of man, but with
<i>doctrine and exhortation taken out of the Holy Scriptures</i>,
and with a life agreeable to the same,&rdquo; the assiduous study
and preaching of the Holy Scriptures have been the main subject
of the charge given to them, from the days of Timothy to the
present.&nbsp; With ministering &ldquo;the Holy Sacraments&rdquo;
they have been most solemnly intrusted; but with <i>preaching the
word </i><span class="GutSmall"><i>CHIEFLY</i></span>: <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and to
<i>this</i> has the &ldquo;success&rdquo; of their ministry been
consigned. <a name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a>&nbsp; This is that which, (as
Anglo-catholic teachers affirm,) &ldquo;to say the least,
Scripture has never much recommended;&rdquo; an assertion very
much to be blamed, as very untrue. <a name="citation39b"></a><a
href="#footnote39b" class="citation">[39b]</a></p>
<p>Now they who are not sensible of the inconceivable importance
of preaching, will not <i>seek</i> the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of preaching, neither will they
<i>have</i> Him, if they do not ask for Him to be given
them.&nbsp; The word, to be &ldquo;the power of <span
class="smcap">God</span> unto salvation,&rdquo; must be
&ldquo;preached <i>with the </i><span class="smcap"><i>Holy
Ghost</i></span> sent down from heaven,&rdquo; <a
name="citation39c"></a><a href="#footnote39c"
class="citation">[39c]</a> &ldquo;not in the words of man&rsquo;s
wisdom, but in the demonstration of the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> and of power.&rdquo; <a
name="citation39d"></a><a href="#footnote39d"
class="citation">[39d]</a></p>
<p>I feel convinced, that after all this, my main position will
be generally admitted to be extremely probable, if not certainly
proved; that we cannot on both sides, have the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> in the ministrations I have
described, though both lay claim to His presence and power in
them. <a name="citation39e"></a><a href="#footnote39e"
class="citation">[39e]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>III.&nbsp; I now, therefore, intreat your permission
briefly to press a third position on your serious consideration,
namely, <i>that whoever of us have Him </i><span
class="GutSmall"><i>NOT</i></span>, <i>they are under most
</i><span class="GutSmall"><i>FEARFUL GUILT</i></span><i> in
</i><span class="GutSmall"><i>PRETENDING</i></span><i> to His
presence</i>.</p>
<p>We all make the pretension.&nbsp; We are guilty therefore, it
is to be feared, on one side or the other: deeply guilty!</p>
<p><i>a</i>.&nbsp; The guilt is that of <i>being false</i>; of
lying in some things <i>concerning</i> the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, and in some things <i>unto</i>
Him, when false before His saints in whom He dwells.&nbsp; Are we
incurring then the very guilt of Ananias and Sapphira?&nbsp; Let
us fear their condemnation.</p>
<p><i>b</i>.&nbsp; Our guilt is also that of <i>resisting</i> the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, in His <i>truth</i>, in
His <i>work</i>, in His <i>people</i>.&nbsp; If we have not known
the ways of <span class="smcap">God</span> aright, we have erred
in our hearts and hardened them,&mdash;against what the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> saith, &ldquo;Harden not your
hearts;&rdquo; and hereby He is grieved: and the result is that
<span class="smcap">God</span> swears in His wrath, that we shall
not enter into His rest. <a name="citation40"></a><a
href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a></p>
<p><i>c</i>.&nbsp; Our guilt is that of substituting <i>another
spirit</i> for Him: the <i>Anti-spirit</i> in league with
Anti-christ.&nbsp; It may be said that I go nigh to affirm that
our work may possibly be the working of Satan, if it be not of
the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>.&nbsp; My brethren, I
mean quite to say it.&nbsp; For of all evil <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>men, who are
instruments of Satan for seduction, false apostles and ministers
are the most so.&nbsp; And the more apparently holy they are, the
more diligent to put on the form of godliness when they have not
the power,&mdash;the more they <i>imitate</i> the love, the
meekness, the humility, the self-denial of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>,&mdash;and profess, at the same time,
that it is by the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> that
hereunto they have attained; the more awful is their reception of
Satan <i>for</i> the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>.&nbsp;
Am I not right in saying, that errors in principle and in
doctrine are quite as full of guilt in the sight of <span
class="smcap">God</span> as sins of the flesh?&nbsp; They are
sins of the mind, it is true: but are the sins of purely
intellectual evil spirits less than the sins of men, because they
are sins of minds and not of fleshly bodies?&nbsp; And is Satan
to be gently dealt with, and not rather the more indignantly
repulsed, when, and because, he comes as an angel of light?&nbsp;
He is the very best imitator in the universe, and will be amiable
in commending heresies to men.&nbsp; And you may take him to your
hearts in the very resemblance of the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
Himself, and assume that you possess the holy anointing of that
blessed <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>; and hence may issue
the most deadly perversions of the truth of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, under the most amiable guise.&nbsp; You
may be making an unction to yourselves, <i>like</i> unto the holy
anointing oil, under that curse of <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span><span class="smcap">God</span>, that
you &ldquo;shall be cut off from His people.&rdquo; <a
name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a>&nbsp; Consider the guilt and
danger!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>IV.&nbsp; We are now prepared to come to the consideration of
our fourth point; <i>That the possession of some accrediting
proofs of the presence of the </i><span class="smcap"><i>Holy
Ghost</i></span><i> is essential to our most important
interests</i>.</p>
<p>Am I a true minister of <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>, or am I not?&nbsp; And if I am, is all as it
should be with me?&nbsp; Have <i>I full proof</i> that <i>my</i>
ministry is a participation in the &ldquo;ministration of the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span>,&rdquo; or have I not?&nbsp; Is
He present with me at all?&nbsp; Is He present with me in all
that fulness and power, that is most justly and rationally and
earnestly to be desired?&nbsp; What are the most certain
credentials or proofs of this?</p>
<p><i>Two</i> are all that I shall refer to: one is in my text;
the other, which I advert to first, is elsewhere found; I mean
the scriptural <i>Character</i> of the true minister of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; You find it concisely
expressed in 2 Tim. iv. 1&ndash;5, &ldquo;I charge thee therefore
before <span class="smcap">God</span> and the Lord Jesus Christ,
who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and His
kingdom,&mdash;<i>Preach the word</i>, be instant in season, out
of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>and
doctrine.&nbsp; Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions,
<i>do the work of an evangelist</i>, <i>make full proof of thy
ministry</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in 1 Tim. iv. 12, &ldquo;Be thou
<i>an example</i> of the believers, in word, in conversation, in
charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.&nbsp; Take heed to
thyself and to the doctrine: continue in them: for in so doing,
thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.&rdquo; <a
name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a></p>
<p>As to integrity in doctrine, enough has been said, we should
imagine, to prove the true servant of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> from the false, the Holy Scripture in
its plainest sense being taken for our guide.</p>
<p>And who, you ask, is to say what the standard of Scripture
doctrine is, and so to determine what we ought to teach?&nbsp;
You must <i>decide for yourselves</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I speak as
unto wise men; judge ye what ye say.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wisdom
is justified of her children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing can possibly
be plainer than Holy Scripture.&nbsp; <i>Pray for the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Holy Spirit</i></span><i> to be your guide</i>
in understanding it.&nbsp; We shall soon see, if we have Him
indeed, &ldquo;who is the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>, and who is
holy,&rdquo;&mdash;without his judgments to convince us.</p>
<p>We must do the same with regard to ascertaining <i>who</i>
have that true consistency of ministerial <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>character and
conduct which is laid down in Scripture, and are therefore those,
whom we should &ldquo;follow; considering the end of their
conversation, <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, the same
yesterday, to-day, and for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consider, brethren, what and where the <i>power</i> of
godliness really is, and where <i>the form</i>; what and where is
the most honest self-abasement, and where, on the other hand, the
exaltation of man by means of office:&mdash;consider whether it
be right to say, where the human commission is, there, and there
only, all is right as to the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>;
and not rather, where the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> is
vitally proved to be, there, and there only, all is right as to
the human commission: consider what is that dominion over the
people&rsquo;s faith, which is to be unselfishly repudiated; and
who is their true servant, for <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
sake, and the fellow-helper of their joy.&nbsp; Think whether it
is indeed and beyond a doubt the fact, that you have yourselves
&ldquo;passed from death unto life,&rdquo; and know what a
wounded spirit is, and what the godly sorrow of a broken and
contrite heart, and the agonizing conviction of being a sinner
deserving eternal condemnation.</p>
<p>I will add nothing concerning the happier experience of a sure
interest in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, of that holiness
without which no man shall see the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>,&mdash;and all the work of the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> in the soul of the believer; and of
the love of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shed abroad in the
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>heart.&nbsp; But such as this, is the personal character
of the true minister of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, which
ought to be a discriminating credential of the presence of the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span> with us.&nbsp; O that we may have it in
all its fulness and excellency!</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The other point, which St. Paul appeals to in the
text, is the <i>effectual blessing of God upon ministerial
labours</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye,&rdquo; says the apostle, speaking
of souls brought out of death into life by his means, &ldquo;Ye
are our Royal letters, which we carry out in our hearts, as
ambassadors for <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, to be read by,
and spoken of unto, all men.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> ordained them on my behalf; I was the
ministering hand by which He wrote; the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span> was with me, and indelibly impressed them on the
tablets of your hearts; the character, and language are those
which pourtray the new creature, the children of the living <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the heirs of everlasting
glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; He disclaims all sufficiency, not only to
write, but even to conceive, what was written, except as it was
given to Him by <span class="smcap">God</span>, (a point they
would readily admit,) and thus, in their conversion by his means,
he had the clearest and strongest evidence that <span
class="smcap">God</span> was with him of a truth.&nbsp; So he
says in another place, &ldquo;The seal of mine apostleship are ye
in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: are not ye my work in the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>?&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is evident
that this is a most essential, decisive, and therefore desirable,
proof of our ministry <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>being of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; I do not think we should by any
means rest and be satisfied without it.&nbsp; I know that a
minister may be a true prophet without always having this
testimony; and though the Israel of <span
class="smcap">God</span> be not gathered by his means, his work
is with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and his judgment
with his <span class="smcap">God</span>; and Isaiah says,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, who hath believed our
report, and to whom hath the arm of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> been revealed?&rdquo;&nbsp; But this is
the <i>exception</i> and not the <i>rule</i>.&nbsp; What are
pastors and teachers for?&nbsp; Truly &ldquo;for the perfecting
of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
the body of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; opening
men&rsquo;s eyes, turning them from darkness to light and from
the power of Satan unto <span class="smcap">God</span>; that they
may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among all them
which are sanctified, by faith that is in <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation46"></a><a
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a>&nbsp; If these holy
and heavenly purposes be not evidently answered by us, what are
we better than others?&nbsp; If they be but feebly and
equivocally answered, why are we not afraid, and put upon inquiry
as to the cause, and upon prayer, most earnest prayer, that we
may not be disowned both of <span class="smcap">God</span> and
man?&nbsp; What letters have we to show that we are not thus
disowned?&nbsp; O that our gracious <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> and master may give us all imperishable
seals of our apostleship in great numbers!&nbsp; Let us earnestly
see to it that we obtain them.&nbsp; The <i>double</i> testimony
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>of
scriptural character, and of such seals given to our ministry, is
irresistible.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But it may be asked, have not even false apostles their
disciples, and sometimes many; Theudas, four hundred; Judas of
Galilee, much people? <a name="citation47"></a><a
href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; They have: but
not of such sinners converted into saints, as evidently prove the
operation to be of <span class="smcap">God</span>; not such as
would glorify <span class="smcap">God</span> on the racks of
persecuting torture; not such as would die martyrs in the flames,
if called to it; nor such as, in peaceful departures, could
triumph through faith in the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, and rejoice in the <i>certain</i>
hope of a glorious immortality.&nbsp; The happy and heavenly
deaths of those who had lived upon the doctrines of Evangelical
Protestantism are immortal and irresistible testimonies in favour
of that sort of Christianity, as the truth of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; They constitute an evidence,
which Anglo-catholics will never be able to produce.&nbsp; What
were the latter days of Froude, their modern proto-saint, if not
their proto-martyr?&nbsp; Where are their dying witnesses?</p>
<p>What do they in the formation of such characters as I speak
of?&nbsp; Here, my honoured fellow-labourers in the Church of
<span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;the questions which I would
put concerning them, allow me to put pointedly to you all.&nbsp;
What are you really doing in the work of the ministry you have
received <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>?&nbsp; Are you
answering the purposes for which you were called to it?&nbsp;
What can you do, by the grace of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Can you convert a sinner from the
error of his way?&nbsp; Can you give me the heart of stone broken
down and melted into the humble and contrite heart?&nbsp; Can you
display a compassionate and crucified <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span>, till men love Him fervently, and
mourn for their sins which pierced Him?&nbsp; Can you heal a
wounded spirit?&nbsp; Can you beautify disciples with Christian
graces?&nbsp; Can you help the saints of <span
class="smcap">God</span> in their preparations for death and
eternal glory, when <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> shall come
and receive them to Himself?&nbsp; Shall you then have any, of
whom you will be humbly able to say, &ldquo;Behold, I and the
children whom Thou hast given me!&nbsp; These are my letters of
commendation!&nbsp; These are my joy and crown of rejoicing:
while all the supreme and sovereign glory, O <span

class="smcap">Robertson</span> observes, in his History of
America, p. 163, &ldquo;Of all the Reformed churches, that of
England has deviated the least from the ancient institutions . .
.&nbsp; Though the Articles to be recognized as the system of
national faith were framed <i>conformable to the doctrines of
Calvin</i>, his notions with respect to church government and the
mode of worship were not adopted.&rdquo;&nbsp; See the same
testimony in Mosheim, Eccles. Hist. vol. iv. p. 87, 88.&nbsp;
Bishop Burnet says, &ldquo;In England, the first Reformers were
<i>generally in the sublapsarian hypothesis</i>; but Perkins and
others asserted the <i>supralapsarian</i>
way.&rdquo;&mdash;Exposition of the Articles, p. 151.&nbsp; Dr.
Heylin, a zealous Arminian, has the following testimony.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of any men who publicly opposed the Calvinian tenets in
this University&rdquo; (Oxford) &ldquo;till after the beginning
of King James&rsquo;s reign, I must confess that I have hitherto
found no good assurance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Buckridge, tutor to Abp.
Laud, and Houson, are all he can name.&nbsp; Quinq. Hist. Works,
p. 626.&nbsp; When Laud preceded about suppressing Calvinistic
doctrines, he could not &ldquo;venture the determining of those
points to a Convocation,&rdquo; so general was the disposition of
the bishops and clergy in favour of them.&nbsp; Heylin&rsquo;s
Life of Laud, p. 147.&nbsp; Bishop Burnet&rsquo;s honest
observations, in the close of his discussion of the Seventeenth
Article, will not be forgotten.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not to be
denied, but that the Article seems to be framed according to St.
Austin&rsquo;s doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Since
the Remonstrants do not deny but that <span
class="smcap">God</span>, having foreseen what all mankind would,
according to all the different circumstances in which they should
be put, do or not do, He upon that did by a firm and eternal
decree lay that whole design in all its branches, which He
executes in time; they may subscribe this Article without
renouncing their opinion as to this matter.&nbsp; On the other
hand, the Calvinists have less occasion for scruple; since the
Article does seem more plainly to favour them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote11"></a><a href="#citation11"
class="footnote">[11]</a>&nbsp; Tract 90, p. 82.&nbsp; They
affirm that their interpretation of the Articles was intended to
be admissible, though not that which the authors took
themselves.&nbsp; This is the old way of putting darkness for
light further carried out.&nbsp; Dr. Powell, Archdeacon of
Colchester, and Master of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,
preached a sermon some forty years ago to instruct the University
in the matter of subscribing to the Articles.&nbsp; And he says,
&ldquo;Where the <i>original sense</i> is one, and the
<i>received</i> another, the subscriber is at liberty to use them
in either.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he never went so far as to say that
the subsequently received sense was <i>intended to be
admissible</i> by the compilers.&nbsp; And Dr. Hey, the Norrisian
Professor, speaks of &ldquo;a religious society changing its
doctrines, and yet retaining the expressions by which they were
defined;&rdquo; and says, &ldquo;In whatever degree the Articles
grow obsolete, the Injunction, (that is, the Royal Declaration,)
must grow so,&rdquo; notwithstanding it commands interpretation
in the literal sense; and &ldquo;that a man, by speaking
according to the literal sense, may speak
falsehood.&rdquo;&mdash;Lectures, vol. ii. p. 68, 72, 74.&nbsp;
This mode of dealing with the Articles, when strongly carried
out, as in the present case, issues, of course, in a total
change.&nbsp; See Overton, p. 22&ndash;26.</p>

say, &ldquo;It may be seen by an attention to the context in all
the passages, where these expressions occur, that it is a very

which St. Paul always intends by it.&nbsp; It is the necessity of

it is <span class="GutSmall">OUR</span> humiliation together with
Him; mortification of the flesh; being made conformable to His
sufferings and death.&nbsp; It was a doctrine which was
foolishness to the wise, and an offence to the Jew, on account of
the debasement of the natural man which it implied.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[18]</a>&nbsp; That Aristotle should teach that
we are to become right-minded by acting rightly, is not to be
wondered at.&nbsp; He knew nothing of the work of the Spirit of
God, or of the love of Christ, or of the impossibility (see Acts
x. and xii.) of our acting rightly without the grace of the Holy
Spirit to give a right mind first.&nbsp; But that Oxford Divines
should teach so is to be wonderfully &ldquo;dark amidst the blaze
of noon!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote19"></a><a href="#citation19"
class="footnote">[19]</a>&nbsp; To be grafted into the church is
to be outwardly admitted into the enjoyment of church privileges
and ordinances.&nbsp; <i>Rightly</i> means, not as hypocrites,
but with the repentance and faith of the regenerate.&nbsp; The
wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, do receive the
sacrament of so great a thing as regeneration to their
condemnation.&nbsp; Not receiving baptism rightly, they have no
true part in the privileges and ordinances of the church, which
are thereby sealed to the faithful.</p>
<p><a name="footnote20"></a><a href="#citation20"
class="footnote">[20]</a>&nbsp; When the invitation is received,
&ldquo;Arise, and be baptised, and wash away thy sins, calling on
the name of the Lord,&rdquo; (Acts xxii. 16,)&mdash;our church
has guided us at once to say, it is the <i>mystical</i>, that is,
the <i>significant</i>, washing away of sins, that is then
accomplished; <i>but</i> so <i>signifying</i> the <i>true</i>,
that a lively recollective enjoyment of it is excited in the
mind.&nbsp; When we are called to obtain the true remission of
sins, it is thus,&mdash;&ldquo;Repent,&rdquo; (there is the
spiritual operation,) &ldquo;and be baptized, every one of you,
in the name of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; (there is the outward sign)
&ldquo;for the remission of sins;&rdquo; or, without any notice
of the sign at all, &ldquo;Repent, and be converted, that your
sins may be blotted out.&rdquo;&nbsp; But repentance, and faith,
and conversion, are the fruits of regeneration.&nbsp; Baptism was
no more intended to <i>impart</i> the spiritual cleansing from
sin, than was the offering of the blood of bullocks and goats;
and yet the people are spoken of as purged by that blood, and
remission of sins as received by it.&nbsp; It was only a mystical
ceremony.&mdash;Circumcision was the same: the thing itself was
mystical: And Baptism is its counterpart; and both of them are
significant of the remission of sins, &ldquo;the putting off the
body of the sins of the flesh,&rdquo; a death unto sin, and a new
birth unto righteousness in Christ Jesus, effected by the Holy
Spirit of God implanting the seed of the Word of Christ in the
soul and vivifying it; before even it is proper that baptism
should be administered.</p>

believeth that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> is the <span

class="footnote">[22b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Except a man be born of
<i>water</i> and of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, he
cannot enter the kingdom of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> comes the spiritual birth, and
thereby the entrance into the spiritual kingdom or church of
<span class="smcap">God</span>: if the water of baptism be meant,
then also figurative birth, and concurrently the visible kingdom
or church to which baptism is the only door: a proper parallelism
of idea being sustained.&nbsp; But probably, as the expression
&ldquo;baptize with the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> and
with fire,&rdquo; means, <i>baptize with the</i> <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> <i>as a spirit of burning</i>, so
&ldquo;born of water and of the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>&rdquo; means, &ldquo;<i>born of the</i> <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> <i>as a Spirit of
washing</i>,&rdquo; the real &ldquo;washing of
regeneration.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last expression is most
frequently understood, and by Archbishop Whitgift and Bishop
Hopkins amongst others, to refer to the sacramental washing, not
the spiritual.&nbsp; But why the force of the term
<i>regeneration</i> should <i>not</i> preponderate over that of
<i>washing</i>, I cannot see.&nbsp; So &ldquo;the washing of
water by the Word,&rdquo; wherewith <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> sanctifies and cleanses His church,
is the ablution, like as of water, that is by the Word, when the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> uses that Word in the
hearts of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be in divers cases,&rdquo; says Hooker,
&ldquo;life by virtue of inward baptism, where outward is not
found.&rdquo;&nbsp; B. v. 60.</p>
<p>The same may be argued concerning the real &ldquo;forgiveness
of sins,&rdquo; and the mystical forgiveness.&nbsp; There is one
spiritual baptism for the actual, and one sacramental baptism,
significant of the same thing, for the significant
remission.&nbsp; Equally distinct and separate, and even more so,
if possible, is justification; of the possession of which by
means of baptism the Scriptures say not a word, neither the
Church of England, nor any other church, but the Church of
Rome.</p>

<p><a name="footnote30"></a><a href="#citation30"
class="footnote">[30]</a>&nbsp; A pledge has respect to a
<i>thing future</i>.&nbsp; The <i>proper</i> order of
regeneration is to <i>precede</i> baptism, which cannot correctly
therefore be a pledge of it?&nbsp; Where does Scripture so
represent it?&nbsp; Circumcision was not a pledge to Abraham of
the righteousness he <i>had</i>: a &ldquo;seal&rdquo; it was.</p>
<p>It is easy enough to state and explain the sound meaning
belonging to our ritual and catechism.&nbsp; But it should be
quite clear and obvious at the first glance, without
explanation.&nbsp; The verbal expressions should be such, as that
the right meaning only should present itself to the mind of the
reader.</p>

of the hands of the presbytery upon Timothy, and the laying of
his own hands upon him; most probably referring to the same
thing.&nbsp; St. Paul, himself a presbyter, possessed an actual
<i>superiority</i>, like other apostles, among many presbyters;
which, by Divine Providence, was continued in the church: and
they who were advanced to it had the name of Bishop (once general
among the presbyters) assigned and limited to them.</p>
<p>In the ordination of Deacons, our Church appoints the laying
on of the hands of the Bishop only.&nbsp; For more of her views

Article.&nbsp; And note the liberal style of the article

with respect to sin generally, the Church, or the ministers
thereof, can only <i>declare</i> the divine absolution of the
truly repenting sinner believing in Jesus.&nbsp; She <i>actually
remits</i> only such outward sins as she can take ecclesiastical
cognizance of, and can retain and censure until openly repented
of and confessed.&nbsp; Our Church expresses herself better in
her Liturgical Absolution, than in that for the Visitation of the
Sick, which might be improved.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
